# Contribute to Torro Forms

Patches, bug reports, translations and any kind of contributions are very welcome. When contributing, please ensure you stick to the following guidelines.

## Contributing Code

When contributing code...

* fork the `develop` branch of the repository on GitHub (do not use the `master` branch)
* make changes to the forked repository
    * make sure you stick to the [WordPress Coding Standards](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/best-practices/coding-standards/)
    * write code that is backward-compatible with PHP 5.6 and WordPress 4.7 functionality
    * test your code with the constant `WP_DEBUG` enabled
* when committing, in addition to a note about the fix please reference your issue (if present)
* push the changes to your fork and submit a pull request to the `develop` branch

After that we will review the pull-request as soon as possible and either merge it, make suggestions on improvements or ask you for further details about your implementation.

## Writing a Bug Report

When writing a bug report...

* tell us what you were looking to achieve
* tell us what should have happened upon doing your action
* tell us what actually happened (please provide screenshots if UI-related)
* feel free to include any notes on your investigations (if you already digged in deeper)

We will take a look at your issue and either assign it keywords and a milestone or get back to you if there are open questions.

## Providing Translations

When providing translations...

* visit our project on [translate.wordpress.org](https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/torro-forms) and sign in with your wordpress.org account (create one if you haven't yet)
* select the language you would like to contribute to
* provide the missing translations
    * make sure you follow the guidelines outlined in the [Translator Handbook](https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/handbook/translating/expectations/)
    * stick to the translation conventions for your locale (if there are any) - you can find these [here](https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/handbook/tools/list-of-glossaries-per-locale/)

After having provided translations, a translation editor will review your submissions soon and approve them as appropriate.
